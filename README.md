## Overview

This project demonstrates how to segment retail customers based on their shopping behavior using a K-means clustering algorithm. We analyze a dataset containing **Age**, **Gender**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score** to identify distinct customer segments. The insights derived can help in developing tailored, data-driven marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `Mall_Customers.csv` and includes:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Customer gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income in thousands of dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: A score assigned based on customer behavior and spending habits.
